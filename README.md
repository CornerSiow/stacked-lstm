# Stacked-LSTM Multivariate Regression Model
This model is make for muscle estimation.
The input are the joints' angle, and the output is the muscle activation value from our laboratory works below:
Saputra, Azhar Aulia, Chin Wei Hong, Tadamitsu Matsuda, and Naoyuki Kubota. "A Real-time Control System of Upper-limb Human Musculoskeletal Model with Environmental Integration." IEEE Access (2023).

We compare the Stacked-LSTM model with:
1) Sequence-to-Sequence Regression Model
2) Random Forest Regression
3) Linear Regression
4) Sequence-to-sequence with Bahdanau Attention Regression Model
5) Multi-layer Perceptron Regression Model
6) Stacked Residual LSTM Regression Model
7) Transformer Regression Model

All these model can found in the directory.
